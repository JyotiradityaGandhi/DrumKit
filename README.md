# DrumKit
Built this for JavaScript Practice

I'm following an online Web Dev course, and built [this](https://jyotiradityagandhi.github.io/DrumKit/) for the same. Is pretty basic but still proud I could learn the basics of JavaScript from this. Email me if you have any suggestions or reccommendation in the resources i should study from to better my skills in JS. CiaoðŸ‘‹!
